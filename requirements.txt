  X 10
  L 50
  C 100
  D 500
  M 1,000

It converts a symbol to an int

It converts an into to a symbol
  - A number written in [16]Arabic numerals can be broken into digits. For example, 1903 is composed of 1, 9, 0, and 3. To write the Roman numeral, each of the non-zero digits should be treated separately. Inthe above example, 1,000 = M, 900 = CM, and 3 = III. Therefore, 1903 = MCMIII

Given a combination of symbols, can find a sum
  When smaller values precede larger values, the smaller values are subtracted from the larger values, and the result is added to the total.

Validations
  Repeats
    - The symbols "I", "X", "C", and "M" can be repeated three times in succession, but no more. (They may appear four times if the third and fourth are separated by a smaller value, such as XXXIX.)
    - "D", "L", and "V" can never be repeated.

  Subtractions
    - "I" can be subtracted from "V" and "X" only.
    - "X" can be subtracted from "L" and "C" only.
    - "C" can be subtracted from "D" and "M" only.
    - "V", "L", and "D" can never be subtracted.
    - Only one small-value symbol may be subtracted from any large-value symbol.

Input
  It can parse a file from an path via arg in command line
  It can detect if a line is to Roman(glob is I), to Arabic(glob glob Silver is 34 Credits), or totaling(how many Credits is glob prok Silver ?)

  when /is\s\d+\sCredits$/
  when /^how much is/
  when ^how many Credits
